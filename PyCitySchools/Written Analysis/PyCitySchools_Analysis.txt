Summarizing the analysis
	After looking through the data, it appears that school budget does not have an effect on passing rates for reading, math, and combined. 
We observe that the schools with the lowest passing rates have higher budgets, than those in the top 5 passing rates. If we look at the spending ranges (per student),
we can see that lower spending ranges (<$585) have higher passing rates than schools with higher spending ranges. 
	We also see that school size may have an impact on passing rate. Schools with a smaller to medium size (<1000 to 2000 students) had higher passing rates 
than schools with a large size (2000-5000). Though, small schools and medium schools are relatively close in overall passing rates (89.88 compared to 90.62). 
	We can also see that grade does not have a large impact on passing rate for the school as a whole; this is shown by the small differences between 9th, 10th, 
11th, and 12th grade passing rates per school.
	Overall, the data analysis shows that Charter schools have better passing rates in math, reading, and combined, than Disctrict schools.
