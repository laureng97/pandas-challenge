Module 4 Challenge- PANDAS
This README contains instructions on where to locate the assignment files for Module 4 Challenge.

Please note that the code written for this challenge was based on the provided starter code. I also had assistance from student, Rebekkah Alexander, and Xpert Learning Assistant. 

Within this repository, there is a file named "PyCitySchools". The code that was written to analyze the data is located within the folder "PyCitySchools". The code file is named "PyCitySchoolsCode.ipynb".

The code analyzes the data found in the csv files within the "Resources" folder, labeled "schools_complete.csv" and "students_complete.csv".

My written analysis on the data is located within the "Written Analysis" folder. The written analysis is a text file labeled "PyCitySchools_Analysis.txt". 

Please disregard the file labeled ".ipynb_checkpoints".

Thank you!
